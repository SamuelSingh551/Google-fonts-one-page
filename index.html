            Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms
            are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly
            and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to
            force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to
            be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural
            reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

            Cabin is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric
            Gill's typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates
            modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the
            geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but has its own
            personality.

            Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and
            print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold
            Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The
            flavour of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a
            tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac
            OS X.)

            Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010
            by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in
            Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the
            Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.

            Playfair Display is an open-source, Transitional (although the high-contrast stokes might place it more in the Modern category) serif typeface designed by Danish type designer Claus Eggers Sørensen in 2011. The design is influenced by typefaces from the mid to late eighteenth century, such as Baskerville. I think it makes an excellent font for titles and headlines (especially the beautiful italic), however, for long stretches of body copy the delicate, high-contrast strokes might hinder readability, especially when used at smaller sizes.

            Ksenia Erulevich, designer of the Alice typeface, was inspired by Lewis Carrol's novel and decided to make a typeface that will be suitable for typesetting that book.It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, having widened proportions, open aperture, and soft rounded features; perfect for long meditative text-setting and headlines.This is in fact Ksenia's first typeface, as part of her diploma project in a Type and Typography course in Moscow, Russia.

              Libre Baskerville “is a web font optimized for body text (typically 16px.) It is based on the American Type Founder’s Baskerville from 1941, but it has a taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast, that allow it to work well for reading on-screen.”
