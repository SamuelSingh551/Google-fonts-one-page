            Playfair Display is an open-source, Transitional (although the high-contrast stokes might place it more in the Modern category) serif typeface designed by Danish type designer Claus Eggers Sørensen in 2011. The design is influenced by typefaces from the mid to late eighteenth century, such as Baskerville. I think it makes an excellent font for titles and headlines (especially the beautiful italic), however, for long stretches of body copy the delicate, high-contrast strokes might hinder readability, especially when used at smaller sizes.

            Ksenia Erulevich, designer of the Alice typeface, was inspired by Lewis Carrol's novel and decided to make a typeface that will be suitable for typesetting that book.It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, having widened proportions, open aperture, and soft rounded features; perfect for long meditative text-setting and headlines.This is in fact Ksenia's first typeface, as part of her diploma project in a Type and Typography course in Moscow, Russia.

              Libre Baskerville “is a web font optimized for body text (typically 16px.) It is based on the American Type Founder’s Baskerville from 1941, but it has a taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast, that allow it to work well for reading on-screen.”

              Cinzel is a typeface inspired in first century roman inscriptions and based on classical proportions. However it’s not a simple revivalism. While it conveys all the ancient history of the latin alphabet it also merges a contemporary feel onto it.

              Fauna is a modern typeface with low contrast strokes and soft terminals that form traditional serifs. Its structure is soft and slightly condensed. It reads clearly in paragraph composition and looks beautiful in headlines.
